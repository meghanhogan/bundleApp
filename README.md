# Project for CMSC 374 Mobile Apps
## welcome to bundle beta
this is a prototype version of the app with the following features:
-local database storage for list items and group members
-editing and deleting items
-creating bundles of certain items
-messaging group members to divide up cost and split grocery bills
to use this app:
-if you are on the home screen, swipe left to enter the app. When on other screens, if you see the bundle logo (stacked boxes) you can navigate back to the home screen. On the home screen you can add group members from your contacts
-in list view you can swipe items right to edit, or left to delete
-clicking the plus button will allow you to add a new item
-tapping an item highlights it, meaning you are going to add it to a bundle. Tap all the items you would like to bundle and then click "bundle" in the lower right hand corner to navigate to the bundle screen
-on the bundle screen you can see what items you have selected and delete items added accidentally. At the bottom of the screen you can see the total cost of the bundle
-clicking "request payment" will divide the cost of the bundle by the size of your group and send a message to all group members alerting them of the cost they owe.
-to navigate backwards through the app use the phone's back button or the bundle logo button when you see it
